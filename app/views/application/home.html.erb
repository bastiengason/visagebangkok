Visage is a multidisciplinary collective based in Bangkok and representing a global experience of visual and musical culture.
We aims to reunite people from different backgrounds that all share the same passion for parties and good music but also design, fashion, cinema and arts in all kinds.
We play House, Deep, Acid, Afro, Latin, Soul, Funk, Disco. Music that inspires, entertains, uplifts and educates. Different tempos and genres, old and new, hard and soulful.
Itâ€™s important to us to follow in the footsteps of David Mancuso, Frankie Knuckles, Larry Levan and all those who revolutionized dance culture forever.
